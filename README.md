# Gachi Data API — Japan Station & Accessibility Data (API · MCP · Open Datasets)

> **This is a hosted service. You do NOT self-host it.**

> The source in this repo is published for transparency; the data lives in the hosted backend, so a local clone will not return data.

Clean, structured **Japan station & accessibility data** for AI agents — available as an **MCP server**, a **REST API**, and free **open datasets**. One key works for both the API and MCP.

- **526 Tokyo stations** — accessible / multipurpose toilets with floor, gender, equipment flags (wheelchair, ostomate, diaper table) and the **nearest station exit** (an original first-party value computed by spatial join — not in any raw dataset).
- **612 municipalities nationwide** — public toilets with wheelchair / baby-seat / ostomate flags, address and coordinates.
- **Free open datasets** — Japan Station Master (entity-resolved, 425 stations) & Ridership 2000–2025, sharing one `station_id`: https://github.com/eng213035/gachi-open-datasets (Zenodo DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21199500`).

Station names accept Japanese (新宿) or romaji (Shinjuku, Kita-Senju) for major stations.

## Connect

- **Endpoint:** `https://api.gachi-tokusuru.com/mcp`
- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP (remote)
- **Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` — free key at https://api.gachi-tokusuru.com

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "japan-toilet": {
      "url": "https://api.gachi-tokusuru.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

| Tool | Argument | Returns |
|------|----------|---------|
| `get_toilet_by_station` | `station` (Japanese or romaji) | Accessible toilets in a Tokyo station, with `nearest_exit` |
| `get_public_toilet_by_city` | `city` (Japanese) | Public toilets in a municipality (top 50 for large cities) |

## REST endpoints

- `GET /v1/station-toilets/search?station=Shinjuku` — accessible toilets in a Tokyo station
- `GET /v1/toilets/nearby?lat=&lng=&radius=&wheelchair=&ostomate=&diaper=` — public toilets near a point
- `GET /v1/stations/{station_id}/hazard` — **official MLIT hazard categories at a station, relayed live** (flood inundation-depth rank, liquefaction/landform, landslide/storm-surge/tsunami presence). Values are returned verbatim from 国土交通省 不動産情報ライブラリ with attribution — **no derived score**, and **not a substitute for official hazard maps**. `station_id` comes from the [Japan Station Master](https://github.com/eng213035/gachi-open-datasets) (e.g. `st_00001`); 327 of 425 stations have coordinates.

All endpoints use the same `Authorization: Bearer <key>` and share one monthly quota. Full spec: `/openapi.yaml`, docs: `/docs`.

## Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gachi-tokusuru.com/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call",
       "params":{"name":"get_toilet_by_station","arguments":{"station":"Shinjuku"}}}'
```

## Pricing

Paid plans are self-serve: after Stripe checkout the customer is redirected to `/activate?session_id=…`, which verifies payment, resolves the plan from the paid amount, and issues the API key on the page (idempotent per session — reload shows the same key). No manual key handling.

## Operational notes (internal)

- **Subscription cancellation is not yet wired to key revocation** (no Stripe webhook in this build). A cancelled subscriber's key keeps working until manually disabled. **Reconcile monthly**: compare Stripe's active subscriptions against issued `key:*` records and disable keys for lapsed subscribers. A `customer.subscription.deleted` webhook → auto-revoke is the next phase.
- Plan detection in `/activate` is by paid amount (`AMOUNT_TO_PLAN`: $19/$49/$149). If a new plan reuses an existing amount, add an explicit mapping.

## Licensing (two layers — read carefully)

  - BODIK nationwide public-toilet open data (**CC BY 4.0** or equivalent municipal terms)
  - English station names via ODPT (Public Transportation Open Data Center)
- `nearest_exit` is an original derived value by gachi-tokusuru.com.
