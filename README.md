# Gachi Data API — Japan Station & Accessibility Data (API · MCP · Open Datasets)

> **This is a hosted service. You do NOT self-host it.**

> The source in this repo is published for transparency; the data lives in the hosted backend, so a local clone will not return data.

**Deep, obscure Japanese data you won't find anywhere else** — stations, accessibility, vacancy, hazards. Hand-verified, English-first, built for AI agents. Available as an **MCP server**, a **REST API**, and free **open datasets**. One key works for both the API and MCP.

- **526 Tokyo stations** — accessible / multipurpose toilets with floor, gender, equipment flags (wheelchair, ostomate, diaper table) and the **nearest station exit** (an original first-party value computed by spatial join — not in any raw dataset).
- **612 municipalities nationwide** — public toilets with wheelchair / baby-seat / ostomate flags, address and coordinates.
- **Free open datasets** — Japan Station Master (entity-resolved, 9,145 stations nationwide) & Ridership 2000–2025, sharing one `station_id`: https://github.com/eng213035/gachi-open-datasets (Zenodo DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21199500`).

Station names accept Japanese (新宿) or romaji (Shinjuku, Kita-Senju) for major stations.

## Tools

| Tool | Argument | Returns |
|------|----------|---------|
| `get_toilet_by_station` | `station` (Japanese or romaji) | Accessible toilets in a Tokyo station, with `nearest_exit` |
| `get_public_toilet_by_city` | `city` (Japanese) | Public toilets in a municipality (top 50 for large cities) |
| `get_station_hazard` | `station_name` (Japanese or romaji) | Official MLIT hazard categories at a station (flood / liquefaction / storm-surge), relayed live, cached 14 days — no derived score. Landslide & tsunami are license-restricted (`available:false` + link to official maps). Not a substitute for official hazard maps. |

## REST endpoints

- `GET /v1/station-toilets/search?station=Shinjuku` — accessible toilets in a Tokyo station
- `GET /v1/toilets/nearby?lat=&lng=&radius=&wheelchair=&ostomate=&diaper=` — public toilets near a point
- `GET /v1/stations/{station_id}/hazard` — **official MLIT hazard categories at a station, relayed live** (flood inundation-depth rank, liquefaction/landform, storm-surge presence). Values are returned verbatim from 国土交通省 不動産情報ライブラリ with attribution, cached 14 days — **no derived score**, and **not a substitute for official hazard maps**. Landslide & tsunami source layers are 一部非商用 (license-restricted), so they return `available:false` with a link to the official hazard maps. Also available as the MCP tool `get_station_hazard(station_name)`. `station_id` comes from the [Japan Station Master](https://github.com/eng213035/gachi-open-datasets) (e.g. `st_00001`); 423 of 425 stations have coordinates (2 remain unlocated → `hazard: null`).

All endpoints use the same `Authorization: Bearer <key>` and share one monthly quota. Full spec: `/openapi.yaml`, docs: `/docs`.

## Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.gachi-tokusuru.com/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call",
       "params":{"name":"get_toilet_by_station","arguments":{"station":"Shinjuku"}}}'
```

## Pricing

Free 1k · Pro $19/100k · All Access $49/200k · Business $149/500k. Full details: https://api.gachi-tokusuru.com

Paid plans are self-serve: after Stripe checkout the customer is redirected to `/activate?session_id=…`, which verifies payment, resolves the plan from the paid amount, and issues the API key on the page (idempotent per session — reload shows the same key). No manual key handling.

## Operational notes (internal)

- **Subscription cancellation is not yet wired to key revocation** (no Stripe webhook in this build). A cancelled subscriber's key keeps working until manually disabled. **Reconcile monthly**: compare Stripe's active subscriptions against issued `key:*` records and disable keys for lapsed subscribers. A `customer.subscription.deleted` webhook → auto-revoke is the next phase.
- Plan detection in `/activate` is by paid amount (`AMOUNT_TO_PLAN`: $19/$49/$149). If a new plan reuses an existing amount, add an explicit mapping.
